# UI/UX Design Charter for Fractured Reality

## Introduction

**Fractured Reality** is an asymmetric multiplayer game set in a glitch-riddled digital space realm, where players navigate fractured realities, manipulate time loops, and battle in short, intense sessions. The UI/UX design must immerse players in a futuristic, chaotic universe blending deep space exploration with digital corruption. The interface should feel alive—glitching subtly to reinforce the theme—while remaining intuitive and non-intrusive to support addictive, fast-paced gameplay. This charter ensures consistency, accessibility, and engagement across all platforms, prioritizing diegetic elements (UI integrated into the game world) for maximum immersion.[1][2]

Key goals:
- Enhance the "glitch in reality" theme through visual distortions and temporal effects.
- Minimize cognitive load during 5-8 minute sessions for quick re-engagement.
- Support 5-player multiplayer dynamics with clear role indicators (Repairers vs. Corruptor).
- Foster addiction via rewarding feedback loops and progression visuals.

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
The palette draws from cosmic voids and digital errors, creating contrast for readability while evoking unease and excitement. The darker scheme enhances the glitch aesthetic and reduces eye strain during intense sessions. Use hex codes for implementation in Godot shaders and UI nodes.

- **Primary: Void Black** (#000000) – Main backgrounds, deep space void; represents the fractured digital abyss.
- **Secondary: Neon Cyan** (#00FFFF) – Highlights, player indicators, ghost trails; symbolizes temporal energy and repair mechanics.
- **Accent: Electric Purple** (#7F00FF) – Abilities, UI panels, progress bars; conveys corruption and mystery.
- **Warning: Glitch Red** (#FF4136) – Critical alerts, Corruptor elements, time slowdowns; signals danger and urgency.
- **Neutral: Digital Gray** (#AAAAAA) – Subtle text, borders; for low-contrast elements to avoid overload.
- **Subtle Background Accent**: Very dark blue (#000510) – Optional subtle tint for panels/containers to add depth while maintaining darkness.
- **Background Effects**: Pure black base with glitch noise overlays and subtle cyan/purple edge glows.

Usage guidelines: Limit to 3-4 colors per screen. High contrast ratios (at least 4.5:1) for text over backgrounds. In multiplayer, Repairers use cooler tones (cyan/blue), while the Corruptor employs warmer accents (purple/red) for quick role identification. The pure black background maximizes contrast and creates a dramatic "floating in space" effect.[3]

### Typography
- **Primary Font: Futura or Similar Geometric Sans-Serif** (e.g., Orbitron for a sci-fi feel) – Clean, modern lines to mimic digital code. Sizes: 24-48pt for headers, 14-18pt for body text.
- **Secondary Font: Monospace (e.g., Courier New or Source Code Pro)** – For HUD counters, logs, and glitch effects; evokes terminal interfaces.
- **Hierarchy**:
  - H1: Bold, 36pt, Neon Cyan – Main titles (e.g., "Match Found").
  - H2: Semi-bold, 24pt, Electric Purple – Subsections (e.g., ability names).
  - Body: Regular, 16pt, Digital Gray – Instructions and stats.
- Effects: Subtle glitch animations on text (e.g., horizontal shift on hover) using Godot's Tween or shaders. Kerning: 1.2 for readability in motion.[1]

### Icons and Graphics
- Style: Pixelated with glitch distortions—sharp edges for futuristic tech, overlaid with static noise for reality fractures.
- Sources: Custom vector icons (SVG) for scalability; 32x32px base size.
- Key Icons: Fragment (glowing shard), Ghost (faded silhouette), Ability (stylized waves for time manipulation), Timer (hourglass with cracks).
- Animations: Smooth 60fps transitions; glitch bursts (1-2s) for errors or deaths.[4]

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Keep UI elements minimal and contextual. HUD shows only essential info (fragments collected, time left, player roles) to avoid clutter during gameplay. Use progressive disclosure—reveal details on demand (e.g., mini-map toggle).[3][1]
   
2. **Consistency**: Uniform placement across screens (e.g., top-left for player stats, bottom for actions). Same button styles (rounded rectangles with glow) and interaction patterns (hover: scale 1.1x, click: pulse glitch).[5][3]

3. **Immersion and Diegetic Integration**: UI feels part of the world—e.g., HUD as a holographic overlay projected from the player's "device." Ghost trails appear as semi-transparent echoes in the environment, not floating bars.[2][4]

4. **Feedback and Responsiveness**: Immediate visual/audio cues for actions (e.g., cyan flash on fragment pickup, red shake on death). Haptic feedback for mobile (vibrate on ability cooldown). Ensure 100ms response time for multiplayer sync.[3]

5. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant. Options for color-blind modes (e.g., patterns over colors), adjustable text size, subtitles for audio cues. High contrast for low-vision; keyboard navigation for PC.[2]

6. **Addictiveness Through Flow**: Visual rewards for progress (e.g., filling progress bar with glitch particles). Short-session optimized: Quick load screens with teaser stats to encourage "one more game".[5]

## UI Components

### HUD (Heads-Up Display)
- **Position**: Semi-transparent overlay at screen edges; fades during idle.
- **Elements**:
  - Top-Center: Round timer (circular progress with glitch cracks; Electric Purple fill).
  - Top-Right: Fragment counter (icon + number; Neon Cyan glow on collect).
  - Bottom-Left: Player roles (avatars with color-coded borders; Corruptor in red).
  - Bottom-Center: Ability icons (3 slots; cooldown overlay with radial timer).
  - Mini-Map: Corner widget showing ghost trails and fragments (toggleable; glitch borders).
- Behavior: Scales with resolution; auto-hides on menu open. Use Godot CanvasLayer for layering.[4]

### Menus and Screens
- **Main Menu**: Central glitch portal with floating menu options. Background: Pure black void (#000000) with animated glitch shader effects and subtle cyan/purple particle overlays.
  - Buttons: Vertical stack with semi-transparent purple backgrounds, hover effect (neon cyan outline + glitch scanline, 1.1x scale).
  - Title: Large glitched text "FRACTURED REALITY" with electric purple glow and subtle horizontal distortion.
  - Sections: Play (Primary action), Settings, Quit.
- **Lobby Screen**: Pure black background with semi-transparent panels. Player list with avatars (glitch portraits). Ready button pulses cyan. Social sidebar accessible via top-left toggle.
- **End Screen**: Victory/Defeat with stats breakdown (e.g., "Fragments: 12/15"). Replay button prominent; glitch transition to menu with reality fracture effect.
- **Settings**: Pure black background with semi-transparent panels. Tabbed (Graphics, Audio, Controls); sliders with real-time previews (e.g., glitch intensity slider shows effect).

### Interactions and Animations
- **Buttons**: Hover: Subtle glow + 10% scale. Click: Inward pulse + glitch ripple (0.2s).
- **Transitions**: Screen fades with horizontal glitch lines (simulating reality fracture).
- **Ghost Trails**: Diegetic trails follow player paths; fade opacity over 10s. Visual: Cyan line with particle echoes.
- **Notifications**: Pop-up alerts (e.g., "Corruptor Incoming") with red glitch borders; auto-dismiss after 3s.
- **Progression UI**: Unlock screens with animated shards assembling into rewards; confetti-like glitch particles.[5]

### Mobile/PC Adaptations
- Touch: Larger hit areas (48x48px min); swipe for mini-map.
- Controller: Highlighted selections with focus glow.
- Responsive: UI scales 0.8x-1.2x based on viewport; test at 1080p/1440p.

## Implementation Guidelines in Godot
- Use Theme resources for global styles (colors, fonts).
- Shaders for glitch effects (e.g., noise texture on UI nodes).
- Signals for UI events (e.g., `ability_used` triggers animation).
- Test: Playtest sessions for usability; heatmaps for interaction hotspots.
- Tools: Godot UI Inspector for prototyping; export to Figma for collaboration.

This charter ensures the UI/UX reinforces the game's addictive, innovative core—blending space exploration's wonder with glitch chaos's tension—while keeping players engaged and informed. Update as gameplay evolves.[2][3]
